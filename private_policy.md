# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how information is collected, used, and shared when using the "Etsy to Pinterest Poster" script developed by Cody Myers (the “Script”).

## 1. Information We Collect

The Script accesses publicly available data from your Etsy shop, including:

- Listing titles
- Listing URLs
- Listing images

No personal data is collected from you, your customers, or Etsy buyers.

The information retrieved from Etsy is used solely to:

- Automatically create pins on your Pinterest board
- Help promote your Etsy items on Pinterest

No data is stored or shared beyond this use.

## 3. Pinterest Integration

This Script requires an access token to post on your Pinterest board via the Pinterest API. This token is stored locally by the user and is never collected or transmitted to third parties.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Script uses:

- [Etsy Open API](https://developers.etsy.com/)
- [Pinterest Developer API](https://developers.pinterest.com/)

Use of those APIs is governed by their respective privacy policies.

## 5. Data Security

Because this Script runs locally on your machine and does not use a server, it does not transmit or store data outside your own environment.
